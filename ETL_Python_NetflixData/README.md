# ⚙️ ETL Process with Python

This repository contains a complete **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipeline built with Python.  
ETL is a fundamental process in data engineering and analytics used to **extract raw data**, **transform it into a clean and usable format**, and **load it into a structured destination** for analysis or business use.

The goal of this project is to process, clean, and prepare raw data efficiently and reliably — ensuring it is ready for decision-making and advanced analytics.

## 🧪 Virtual Environment

To keep dependencies isolated and consistent, a **virtual environment** was created using Python’s built-in `venv` library.  
This allows the project to run independently without affecting your global Python environment.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following main directories:

- 📥 **`data/raw/`** – Contains raw, unprocessed files from external sources (e.g., Excel, CSV)  
- 📤 **`data/ready/`** – Stores transformed and clean data, ready for analysis or reporting

---

## 🔁 ETL Workflow

1. 🧾 **Extraction** – Raw data is collected from the `data/raw/` folder  
2. 🧹 **Transformation** – The data undergoes cleaning, formatting, and standardization  
3. 🚨 **Error Detection** – A validation step identifies and handles inconsistencies or anomalies  
4. 💾 **Load** – Processed data is exported to the `data/ready/` folder for further use

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- 🐍 **Python** – Core programming language  
- 📊 **Pandas** – Powerful data analysis and transformation library  
- 📄 **Openpyxl** – Reading and writing `.xlsx` Excel files  
- 📈 **XlsxWriter** – Exporting styled Excel files for reporting

---

## 🗃️ Data Source

The data used in this ETL simulation is based on anonymized information inspired by **Netflix platform user data**, used strictly for educational and non-commercial purposes.

---

## 🧼 Data Lifecycle

- 🪨 **Raw Data** – Untouched data in its original form  
- 💎 **Ready Data** – Clean, validated, and transformed datasets suitable for analysis

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- ✅ Deliver a clean and reproducible ETL process  
- ✅ Ensure data quality, consistency, and traceability  
- ✅ Provide a base for further analysis, dashboards, or machine learning models
