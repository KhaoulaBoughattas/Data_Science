## ðŸ§  What is Data Science?

**Data Science** is the discipline of extracting actionable insights from raw data through a combination of programming, mathematics, and domain expertise. It goes beyond basic reporting or visualization â€” it's about solving complex problems, making accurate predictions, and driving automated decision-making.

### Why is Data Science Important?

- **Data is the new oil.** Organizations collect enormous amounts of structured and unstructured data. Without data science, this information remains untapped and unproductive.
- **Predictive Power.** From forecasting stock prices to predicting equipment failures, machine learning algorithms give companies a competitive edge through foresight.
- **Optimization and Automation.** In areas like supply chain, logistics, and user experience, data-driven models optimize processes and reduce waste.
- **Personalization at Scale.** Streaming platforms, e-commerce, and mobile apps use data science to personalize recommendations for millions of users in real-time.
- **Risk Management.** Financial institutions rely on models to detect fraud, assess credit risk, and comply with regulations.
- **Scientific Discovery.** NASA and other space agencies use data science to process astronomical data, simulate missions, and manage satellite telemetry.

## ðŸ“‚ Projects Included

- [**Azure**](https://github.com/AndreLuiz-Cardoso/Data-Science/tree/main/Azure)  
  Projects using Microsoft's Azure ecosystem, including certifications such as **DP-100** and **AI-900**. These demonstrate:
  - Training and managing machine learning models in the cloud
  - Deploying models as APIs for real-time use
  - Automating pipelines for scalable data workflows

  **Real-world Relevance:** Financial scoring systems, real-time fraud detection, healthcare diagnostics using cloud ML services

- [**ETL Pipeline with Netflix Data**](https://github.com/AndreLuiz-Cardoso/Data-Science/tree/main/ETL_Python_NetflixData)  
  A structured ETL pipeline using Python and Pandas to transform raw Netflix data into analysis-ready formats:
  - Extracts raw CSV data
  - Cleans and transforms content metadata
  - Prepares dataset for BI tools and dashboards

  **Real-world Relevance:** User engagement analysis, content performance benchmarking, viewer segmentation

- [**Global Stock Price App**](https://github.com/AndreLuiz-Cardoso/Global_Stock_Price_App)  
  A real-time financial dashboard built with **Streamlit**, enabling users to compare historical stock performance across **Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·**, **USA ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸**, and **Europe ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º**.  
  It includes:
  - Interactive date range filtering  
  - Automatic portfolio return simulation  
  - Dynamic line charts using live market data from Yahoo Finance  
  - Robust handling of missing or sparse datasets  

  **Real-world Relevance:** Investment analysis, asset comparison tools, financial analytics dashboards.
