## üîó Projects

### üßä [Project 1 - Ice Cream Sales Forecasting](./Project-1/)
An end-to-end regression solution using Azure ML to forecast ice cream sales based on temperature data. It includes:

- A manual ML pipeline built with **Azure ML Designer**
- An automated experiment with **Azure AutoML** for model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and performance comparison
- Key outputs tracked using **MLflow** and reproducible environments via **Conda/YAML**

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Azure ML Pipelines
- AutoML Experimentation
- Data Preprocessing & Regression
- MLflow Tracking and Evaluation

### ü§ñ [Project 2 - Scientific RAG Chatbot Using Azure AI Foundry](./Project-2/)
This innovative project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** chatbot using **Azure AI Foundry** and vector embeddings. It enables question answering from **three peer-reviewed scientific articles** on AI and blockchain.

- Built using **Azure Cognitive Search**, **LangChain**, and **GPT-4 via Azure OpenAI**
- Document processing and chunking of PDFs
- Result validation via Azure AI Playground with contextual screenshots

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Vector Embedding + RAG Architecture
- AI Document Intelligence
- Azure OpenAI & LangChain Integration
- Scientific Data Extraction & NLP

## üöÄ Why This Stands Out

### üéØ **Certification-Oriented**
Each project reflects critical competencies required for the **DP-100 certification**, including model development, evaluation, and deployment in cloud environments.

### üåê **Industry-Relevant Topics**
- Demand forecasting with climate data
- Scientific AI chatbots for legal, healthcare, or academic scenarios
- Blockchain for AI transparency‚Äîhighly aligned with **EU AI Act** and future compliance needs

### üß† **Technical Rigor**
- End-to-end ML lifecycle: from dataset ingestion to prediction & monitoring
- Versioned models (`model.pkl`, `MLmodel`)
- Conda-based reproducibility with `conda.yaml` and `requirements.txt`

### üõ† **Tools & Stack**
- Microsoft Azure ML Studio
- Azure AutoML + MLflow
- Azure AI Foundry (Chat Playground)
- Cognitive Search, LangChain, GPT-4
- Python, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost

### üíº **Business-Ready Architecture**
- Suitable for real-world deployment via Azure Container Instances or AKS
- Clear outputs and metrics for stakeholders
- PDF-based data pipelines usable in internal knowledge management, research, or compliance bots
